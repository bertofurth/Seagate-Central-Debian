# Debian for Seagate Central NAS

WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT FINISHED

These instructions 

Note that these instructions only get you to the point of installing
a very basic Debian based Linux operating system. No other tools
or utilities, such as samba file services or a web management interface
are installed.

Virtually all you'll be able to do after installing the image is ssh
into the unit and then set it up yourself.



Install Debian Linux on a Seagate Central NAS

See  Brief Image Creation Notes file for very broad steps on how this 
Debian image was created. 

Post installation steps

Need to change root and "sc" user passwords

Need to format and mount /Data partition. Potentially might set it up as "home".

Notes

Note about webmin working but not particularly quickly

Note about performance being slower than native Seagate Central but obviously
it's more versatile

Try loading packages required to compile linux and see if you can get it to work.
